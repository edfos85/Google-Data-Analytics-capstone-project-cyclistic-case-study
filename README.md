# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study
Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)


##**Introduction**
The Cyclistic Bike Share case study is a capstone project for Google Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera.
As part of this project I will follow the data analytics process that I learned from the course to ask, prepare, process, analyse, share and act.


##**Business Objective**
The primary objective of this case study is to conduct a thorough analysis of Cyclistic's bike-sharing data to uncover insights into how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, tasked with this analysis, I will delve into the historical bike trip data to discern patterns and behaviors that distinguish these two rider groups. This analysis will serve as the cornerstone for the development of a targeted marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, a pivotal goal in Cyclistic's quest for future growth and success. Additionally, we aim to identify the drivers behind casual riders' decisions to purchase annual memberships and explore the potential of digital media in influencing this conversion process. Our findings and recommendations will play a vital role in shaping Cyclistic's marketing approach and achieving its objectives.
